'''Send email notifications.

Email notifications can be sent using an existing SMTP server such as GMail or Outlook. Notification can be used to send a regular email, or a text message. See the following carrier domain reference, or search online for a list of SMS carrier domains if yours is not listed below.

Common North America SMS carrier domains:
- XXXXXXXXXX@vtext.com (limited to 160 characters)
- XXXXXXXXXX@text.att.net
- XXXXXXXXXX@tmomail.net
- XXXXXXXXXX@txt.bellmobility.com
- XXXXXXXXXX@pcs.rogers.com

The current best practice for services like GMail is to use app passwords in place of your account password. App passwords are passwords that are specific to a single 3rd party application. This makes it easier to control access to your account. Typically you have to enable two-factor authentication on your account before you can use app passwords. You can enable two-factor authentication on a Google account by visiting [https://myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security). You can configure an app password for use with pyjs8call by visiting [https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/apppasswords). Once the app password is generated, copy and paste it into your script in place of your password when calling *set_smtp_credentials()*.

The default SSL context is used to establish a secure connection to the SMTP server.

Example (default GMail SMTP server):

```
import pyjs8call
js8call = pyjs8call.Client()
js8call.start()

# set SMTP server credentials
js8call.notifications.set_smtp_credentials('email.address@gmail.com', 'app_password')
# set destination email address to a Verzion mobile number
js8call.notifications.set_email_destination('2018675309@vtext.com')
# enable automatic email notifications
js8call.notifications.enable()
```
