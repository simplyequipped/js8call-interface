'''Monitor offset frequency based on activity in the pass band.

The offset frequency is automatically moved to an unused portion of the pass band if a recently heard signal overlaps with the current offset. Signal bandwidth is calculated based on the speed of each heard signal.

Only decoded signal data is available from the JS8Call API, so other QRM cannot be handled.
