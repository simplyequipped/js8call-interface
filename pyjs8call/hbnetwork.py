'''Manage outgoing heartbeat network messaging.

JS8Call heartbeat networking cannot be started while running the application headless, since a button click on the user intefrace is required. This module recreates basic outgoing heartbeat network messaging while running headless. This module only sends heartbeat messages on a time interval in the heartbeat sub-band. Automatic replies such as heartbeat acknowledgements are handled by the JS8Call application.

from pyjs8call import OffsetMonitor, Message

class HeartbeatNetworking:
    '''Manage outgoing heartbeat network messaging.

    Send heartbeat messages automatically on a time interval. The JS8Call offset frequency will automatically change to an available offset in the heartbeat sub-band (500 - 1000 Hz) during transmit, and back to the previous offset at the end of the transmission. If no frequency is determined to be available (lots of recent activity), or if there is no recent activity, a random frequency in the heartbeat sub-band is selected. This is consistent with JS8Call heartbeat offset frequency selection.

    The heartbeat time interval is read from the JS8Call config file. See *Client.settings.set_heartbeat_interval()* to set the time interval. The time interval can be changed while pyjs8call heartbeat networking is enabled.

    Outgoing message activity (including JS8Call autoreplies) will reset the timer for the next heartbeat message. This is consistent with JS8Call funtionality.

    Heartbeat messages are not sent if JS8Call modem speed is set to turbo. This is consistent with JS8Call funtionality.
